    "<li><strong style=\"color: #FF6347;\">What Jobs are Available in the Market?</strong><br>\n",
    "    The first step in your job search journey is to identify the various job opportunities available in the market.

    "    Once you have a comprehensive list of potential job titles, it's time to narrow down your choices. Reflect on your interests, skills, and long-term career goals. Ask yourself what job truly excites you and aligns with your passion. Additionally, look for similar job titles or roles that might encompass your interests.

    "<li><strong style=\"color: #FF7F50;\">What Certifications Should I Pursue?</strong><br>\n",
